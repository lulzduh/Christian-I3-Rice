These are my configuration files for the popular window manager i3 and the bar polybar.

Make sure the battery.sh is in ~/.config/polybar which fetches battery percentage and puts in on the bar.

Make sure the launch.sh is in ~/.config/polybar which will launch polybar on i3 launch.

Make sure the config.ini is in /etc/polybar which is the actual place where polybar gets its theme from.

Make sure the config is in ~/.config/i3 which is where i3 gets its theme from.
